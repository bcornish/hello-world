I am trying to add this new feature.
This is a text file from my first local branch that I made.
I made this branch called testingfeature by calling 'git branch testingfeature'
Then I switched to the branch by calling 'git checkout testingfeature'.
Then I called 'touch ~\hello-world\testfile' to make this txt file.
Then I called 'vi testfile' to edit it.
And here we are.
